##GITHUB REVIEW
- in order to collaborate on a repo without overwhelming with too many changes, you can fork the repo and create a pull request (what we are doing now)
- trying to contribute at main repository (think of them as a other branches):
- 1. for the repository and then clone it
  2. add remotes - origin points to your repository upstream points to the repository you are trying to contribute to
  3. then work in your repo, add, commit then it will create a pull request
